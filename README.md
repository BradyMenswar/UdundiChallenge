## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See an animation on the "Explore" text on page load.
- See an animation on the text box when "More Details" is clicked.

### Links

- Live Site URL: [Live Version](https://bradymenswar.github.io/UdundiChallenge/)

## My process

### Built with
- VueJS
- SCSS
- Bootstrap

### Continued development

I believe that with more time put in to this project I would reconsider my initial approach and try to use an svg for the button and morph it to more closely replicate the intended effect. This project took around 3 1/2 hours.
